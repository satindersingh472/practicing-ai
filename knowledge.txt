There are many algorithm for machine learning and they can be divided into Regression and classification algorithms

Regression is where model predicts the number. It is the relationship between the features and labels.
after we have fetures and labels then split the data into training and testing subsets

to calculate the loss we can use root mean squared error method 
1.Regression algorithms predict a y value that is a numeric value such as a price or the number of the sales.
2.classification algorithms predicts to which class or category an observation belongs

Regression can work with small set of dataset
Linear Regression is the simplest form of regression
Decision Trees take a step by step approach to predicting a variable
Ensemble algorithms constucts large number of trees - allowing better predictions on more complex data - Random forest is an example of Ensemble algorithm.


The first step should be to explore the data and find relationship
